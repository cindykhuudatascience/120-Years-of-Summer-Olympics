# IST687-AppliedDataScience-120-Years-of-Summer-Olympics
This was the final project for my Applied Data Science Class. 
This is an analysis on a Kaggle dataset call 120 Years Of Olympics games, where explore trends in medal count and participaton over the history of the Olympics to define variables to build a model that will to predict winner with most gold medals. This would allow us to predict the winner for the next Summer Olympics. 

Included are two files: a written paper and R programming script. 

1. IST_687_Applied_Data_Science_120_Years_Olympics.docx, the written paper is a word document that details this analysis. 

2. IST_687_Applied_Data_Science_120_Years_Olympics_Code.R is the R programming script created for this analysis, which can be viewed through GitHub. You may download R too to view the code if needed.
